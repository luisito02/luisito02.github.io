## Q1 (1 pts)

##### The dataset `quakes` contains information about earthquakes occurring near Fiji since 1964. The first few observations are listed below. 

```{R}
head(quakes)
```

##### How many observations are there of each variable (i.e., how many rows are there; show using code)? How many variables are there total (i.e., how many columns are in the dataset)? You can read more about the dataset [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/quakes.html) *Do not forget to include the code you used to find the answer each question*

```{R}
# your code here
NROW(quakes)

NCOL(quakes)
```

*Your typed answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## There are 1000 obervations and 5 Variables Total [lat, long, depth, mag, stations].

---

## Q2 (2 pts)

##### What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for the variables `mag` and `depth`? Note that there are many functions that can be used to answer this question. If you chose to work with each variable separately, recall that you can access individual variables in a dataframe using the `$` operator (e.g., `dataset$variable`). Describe your answer in words.

```{R}
# your code here

min(head(quakes)$mag)
max(head(quakes)$mag)
mean(head(quakes)$mag)
median(head(quakes)$mag)

min(head(quakes)$depth)
max(head(quakes)$depth)
mean(head(quakes)$depth)
median(head(quakes)$depth)

```

*Your typed answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## The minimum, maximum, mean and median Magnitudes are 4, 5.4, 4.42 (rounded), and 4.15 Mags.
## The minimum, maximum, mean and median Depths are 42, 650, 454 and 594.

---

## Q3

##### Recall how logical indexing of a dataframe works in R. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask R for the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175. The two ways produce equivalent results.

```{R}
median(quakes$mag[quakes$long>175])

median(quakes[quakes$long>175,]$mag) #this is the more conventional notation
```

### 3.1 (1 pt) 
##### Explain what each of the two lines of code are doing in words. Specifically, why do we need to use the comma in the second case but not in the first? Remember that the `$` selects a single variable that `[ ]` are used for indexing whatever object came before (either a single variable or a dataframe).

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## Since $ Accesses individual Variables the first one looks into the magnitudes first and checks for while the second checks the entire list for items more than 175 and then references mag.The comma is necessary for the second case bc it ignores the second parameter of whatever it is trying to gain.

### 3.2 (3 pts) 
##### What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's depth and its magnitude?

```{R}
# your code here

mean(quakes$mag[quakes$depth>median(quakes$depth)])

mean(quakes$mag[quakes$depth<median(quakes$depth)])

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## The depth and Magnitude are inversly related.

### 3.3 (2 pts) 
##### What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's latitude and it's depth?

```{R}
# your code here

sd(quakes$lat[quakes$depth>median(quakes$depth)])

sd(quakes$lat[quakes$depth<median(quakes$depth)])

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*
## It is cause the Earthquakes Latitude and Depth are inversely Related.
---

## Q4 (2 pts)

##### The variable `depth` is measured in kilometers. Create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives depth **in meters rather than kilometers** and add it to the dataset `quakes`. To help get you started, I have given you code that creates the new variable but fills it with `NA` values. Overwrite the `NA`s below by writing code on the right-hand side of the assignment operator (`<-`) that computes the requested transformation. Print out the first few rows of the updated dataset using `head()`.

```{R}
# update the code below by replacing the NA with the correct expression to convert to meters

quakes$depth_m <- quakes$depth*1000
head(quakes$depth_m, n= 10)

```


## Q5

##### Let's make some plots in base R. 

### 5.1 (2 pt) 
##### Create a boxplot of `depth` using the `boxplot()` function. Describe where you see the min, max, and median (which you calculated in question 2) in this plot.

```{R}
# your code here

boxplot(quakes$depth, main="Depth Boxplot")

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## The Min is on the top line and the Max is  on the top line and the Med is the line within the box itself.

### 5.2 (2 pt) 
##### Create a histogram of `depth` using the `hist()` function. What important information does the histogram provide that the boxplot does not?

```{R}
# your code here

hist(quakes$depth, main="Depth Histogram",xlab="Depths")

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## A histogram describes the data set at ease of understanding. We can see how a graph is skewed and how its distributed, espically how its split in the middle. 

### 5.3 (2 pt) 
##### Create a scatterplot by plotting variables `mag` and `stations` against each other using the `plot()` function. Note that to generate a scatterplot, the `plot()` takes two arguments: the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. Describe the relationship between the two variables.

```{R}
# your code here

plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations, main = "Scatterplot of Mag and Stations",
     xlab = "mag", ylab = "stations")

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## Mag. and Stations have a positive linear relationship that with some points are outliers, more as we go outward.


### 5.4 (3 pt) 
##### Create scatterplot of the quakes' geographic locations by plotting `long` on the x-axis and `lat` on the y-axis. Using this plot, and the map/link below (note the two trenches), and some of the techniques you practiced above, are deeper quakes more likely to originate east or west of Fiji?

```{R fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# your code here

plot(x=quakes$long, y=quakes$lat, main = "Quakes' geographic locations",
     xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "latitude")

mean(quakes$depth[quakes$long>175])

mean(quakes$depth[quakes$long<175])

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

## The Deeper Quakes are more leaning to start east of Fiji with mean depths longitude are greater than 175 shows to be 374.9182 and higher to quantity.
